E-Dreams for Medical Appointments, on steroids. It's a digital medical clinic aggregator/ marketplace, where patients can not only book, but also sell their medical appointments online, using NFTs.

Healthcare is fragile to disorganization, and it all starts with the medical appointment, a billion dollar pain-point no one has solved, yet. The “no shows”, which in Europe alone represent 6Bn USD of unearned revenue for hospitals with just 13% churn, is mainly caused by patients forgetting their appointments due to lack of incentives and a low quality/fragmented UX. 

With Archangel, patients will be able to 1) Find more available appointments than they usually do (because of the creation of a secondary market of appointment time slots), 2) Pay for medical appointments in advance at a discount (because the payer, the hospitals or medical insurance companies, got lower chance of churn and can afford this discount), and 3) Doctors, Insurance and Hospitals will be able to better understand and follow on patients schedules (due to a reduced no-show). This is all possible thanks to the creation of a liquid secondary market of tickets/appointments, which are NFTs!. The best part is, the UX will be web2 and super simple for any non-crypto native to onboard and take advantage of this marketplace. And with better understanding of appointments and health medical history/records, scheduling is just the beginning! Archangel will become the next-generation healthtech platform bringing health information on chain and freeing users from the inherited burdens of an incumbent that has not been disrupted, until now!
